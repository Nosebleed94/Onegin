   'Tis dark by now. He gets into a sleigh.
   'Tis sacred to Apollo's nephews;
   'Tis time, 'tis time! To it I call;
   'Twas stillness all; only night sentries
   'Twas then his father died.
   'tis high time were discovered,
   then I shall start to write a poem

  A magic region! There in olden years
  A malady, the cause of which
  Adrian waves,
  Again imagination seethes,
  Ah me, I long could not forget
  Alas, on various pastimes I have wasted
  All Eugene knew besides
  All clap as one. Onegin enters:
  All of a sudden he indeed
  All of us had a bit of schooling
  Although, perhaps, this or that dame
  Am I to hear again your choruses?
  Am I to see Russian Terpsichore's
  Amber on Tsargrad's pipes,
  Amors, diaboli, and dragons
  And my Onegin? Half asleep,
  And once again to idleness consigned,
  And you, young beauties, whom
  Apostate from the turbulent delights,
  Are all of you the same? Have other maidens
  As to the greenwood from a prison
  At first, Onegin's language
  Be off, then, to the Neva's banks,
  Before Onegin there assembled
  Before all others you he left;
  Betrayals had time to fatigue him. Friends
  Brought up in Oriental mollitude,
  But 'tis enough extolling haughty ones
  But by the tumult of the ball fatigued,
  But so be it. With partial hand
  But to this day, if morals did not suffer,
  But was my Eugene happy —
  But you, blest husbands,
  But, 'mid the night's diversions, sweeter
  By now the house is full; the boxes blaze;
  By prophesying to the gaze
  Capricious belles of the grand monde!
  Corneille's majestic genius;
  Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks, are charming,
  Eugene stood pensive — as himself
  Eugene, detesting litigations,
  Eugene, the sad epistle having read,
  Faith, nobody, my friends, I swear!
  Fate guarded Eugene:
  Faublas' disciple of long standing,
  Flowers, love, the country, idleness,
  For two days new to him
  Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
  From you, my friends, at present
  Having cast off the burden of the monde's conventions,
  Having served excellently, nobly,
  He found the grounds full of attendants;
  He had no inclination
  He like Childe Harold, gloomy, languid,
  He who has lived and thought
  He will awake past midday, and again
  His father could not understand him,
  How early he already could disturb
  How early he was able to dissemble,
  How he was able to seem new,
  How languorously he was silent,
  How much I wished then with the waves
  How oft in summertide, when limpid
  I cheerlessly went through.
  I have long ceased to sin.
  I have no leisure to recount;
  I have remembrance of another time:
  I hold the happy stirrup
  I like it, dear Elvina,
  I like riotous youth,
  I might before the learned world
  I recollect the sea before a tempest:
  I roam above the sea,10 I wait for the right weather,
  I spent my happiest days?
  I still feel sad; but there are no more tears,
  I still remember them, and in sleep they
  I suffered, where I loved,
  I wander by a wasteful lake
  I was born for the peaceful life,
  I was mad about balls:
  I wish I could present you with a gage
  I write, and the heart does not pine;
  I'll offer you my services;
  I'm always glad to mark the difference
  I've thought already of a form of plan
  If this I write it is because
  In French impeccably
  In days of gaieties and desires
  In front of darkened houses,
  In this connection I'll observe: all poets
  Is it long since I would forget for you
  It happened, he'd be still in bed
  It used to happen that dear objects
  Italy's nights at liberty I'll revel,
  Lacking the lofty passion not to spare
  Latin has gone at present out of fashion;
  London the trinkleter deals in
  Love passed, the Muse appeared,
  Love's mad anxiety
  Meantime, my novel's
  Meanwhile, in morning dress,
  Monsieur l'Abbé, a poor wretch of a Frenchman,
  Morn's pleasant hubbub has awoken,
  My Eugene, a second [Chadáev],
  My goddesses! What has become of you?
  No, feelings early cooled in him.
  No, never midst the fiery days
  Not this is our concern at present:
  Now my Onegin is at large:
  Now our Onegin is a rural dweller,
  O Brenta! Nay, I'll see you
  O you, respected husbands!
  On top of that they are so pure,
  Once free, I seek again the concord
  One can be an efficient man —
  Onegin drives to the boulevard
  Onegin has flown to the theater,
  Onegin locked himself indoors;
  Onegin was prepared with me
  Onegin was, in the opinion
  Onegin, a good pal of mine,
  Or when he wanted to annihilate
  Resplendent, half ethereal,
  Rousseau (I shall observe in passing) was unable
  Shall I present a faithful picture
  So when and where, in what desert, will you
  So whither is my scamp to scurry?
  Studded around with lampions,
  Tedious to him became the social hum.
  The advocate of liberty and rights
  The cry “Way, way!” resounds.
  The dead man was interred,
  The fairs remained not long
  The happiness of youthful years has vanished
  The hero of my novel,
  The merchant's up, the hawker's out,
  The theater's unkind
  Then, when the season of tumultuous youth
  Theocritus and Homer he disparaged,
  There formerly I too promenaded —
  Thirst is still clamoring for beakers
  Three hours, at least,
  Thus a young scapegrace thought
  To Talon's4 he has dashed off: he is certain
  To harmless leisures consecrated,
  To others his example is a lesson;
  To shoot himself, thank God,
  To whom did you, among the throng
  Under the cope of storms, with waves disputing,
  Up to the porch our hero now has driven;
  Was it to him of no avail
  What base perfidiousness
  What snares prepare for them!
  What? Invitations? Yes, indeed,
  Whatever, for the lavish whim,
  Where are you? Hearken to my woeful voice:
  Whom will he start with? Never mind:
  Whose gaze, while stirring inspiration,
  Will the hour of my freedom come?
  With frostdust silvers
  With one thing breathing, one thing loving,
  With soul full of regrets,
  With toilette in the latest taste
  You too, mammas: most strictly
  a bloody roast beef is before him,
  a disenchanted lorgnette,
  a greedy host of creditors.
  a learned fellow but a pedant.
  a lot of life!
  a report that his uncle was nigh death in bed
  a state grows rich,
  abandoned the inheritance to them,
  about the old.

  absolute lord (while up to then he'd been

  adorer of enchanting actresses;

  all this I have looked over closely;
  all this adorned the cabinet
  alongst the sleeping street in rows
  although there were no streets, no palaces,

  amidst resplendent conquests,
  an iamb from a trochee —
  an unpriced recompense,
  and — joyance of the pampered senses —
  and a golden ananas.
  and afterward, alone with her,
  and at an alien world having directed
  and banter blent halfwise with bile
  and beats one swift small foot against the other.
  and by the roar of violins is drowned
  and bygones recollect?
  and far niente is my rule.
  and friendship palled,
  and from his dressing room came forth
  and give away my labors' fruits
  and he remembered, though not without fault,
  and how my hero I shall call.
  and it is true that in our years
  and it kept running after him
  and leaning on the granite,
  and lo! a leap, and lo! she flies,
  and luminous is the nocturnal sky
  and meanwhile fame he captured too —
  and mind the beauty of one's nails:
  and mortgaged his lands.
  and o'er the Baltic waves to us
  and outworn was the old, and the new raved
  and project rainbows on the snow.
  and read, and read — and all for nothing:
  and round the fires the coachmen curse their masters
  and scatter piquant sayings when

  and sigh, 'mid the meridian swell, beneath the

  and soon, soon the storm's trace
  and the considered dresses of the ladies;
  and the dark mind cleared up.
  and the distrustful oldster,
  and the far clip-clop of some droshky
  and the heart's sorrowful remarks.
  and to the Letniy Sad took him for walks.
  and truffles, luxury of youthful years,
  and turning morning into midnight,
  and very glad to have exchanged
  and virulence of somber epigrams.

  and yet Onegin has already left;
  and, filled anew with inspiration,
  and, in the distance, captivated us

  are as deceptive as their little feet.
  are friends of fancifying love.
  as a prepared tribute to earth.
  as on the meadows your light trace.
  as well as captives of the Salgir's banks.
  as with post horses in the dust he flew,
  ascends in a blue column, and the baker,

  at the very morn of our days.

  being afraid of jealous censures,
  beneath the long napery of tables,
  between a living Limburg cheese

  bored with their harness,
  but “dress coat,” “waistcoat,” “pantaloons” —
  but Bréguet's chime reports to them
  but I, when loving, was stupid and mute.
  but even of Didelot I've had enough.”5
  but harmful is the North to me.1

  but soon we were to be by fate
  but to correct them I don't wish.

  but, good God, what a bore to sit
  by a sick person day and night, not stirring
  by the most lofty will of Zeus
  by the sea on granite of rocks.

  call out Moëna — for the purpose

  cannot help in his soul despising men;
  capture the minute of softheartedness;
  carry away over the pavement
  choosing a useful trade,
  combs, little files of steel,
  conceal a hope, show jealousy,
  conquer by means of wits and passion,
  contented with his lot,
  danced the mazurka lightly, and
  dared clean his nails in front of him,
  dear friends! Nevertheless, for me

  did not engage him any more;

  fame's tribute: false interpretations,
  familiar faces on the dreary stage,
  follow your daughters with your eyes;
  for Eugene came,
  for country quiet:
  for him there are no more enchantments;
  for sighs, boredom, and guile
  for strife, saber and lead.
  forget them, madman? Little feet,
  free, in the bloom of the best years,
  from Romulus to our days,

  hair cut after the latest fashion,

  has entered. The ballroom is full of people;
  has more than once already
  has turned away, and yawned,
  having donned a broad bolivar3,
  having engaged your curious glance,
  having grown fond of friendship's heed,
  having, as he, from vain pursuits desisted,
  he could express himself and write,
  he crammed a shelf with an array of books,
  he did keep in his memory.
  he did not care to try,
  he drives from ball to bed,
  he ended, in Moldavia,
  he forced one to respect him
  he found him laid already on the table
  he had enough knowledge of Latin
  he had the headache;
  he has exchanged salutes; then at the stage
  he has flown up the marble steps,
  he has scanned all the tiers;
  he has seen everything; with faces, garb,
  he lost at last his liking
  he noticed nothing.
  he settled down with the laudable aim
  he spent in front of glasses,
  he walks — on people's toes — between the stalls;
  he's dreadfully displeased;
  he's driving home to dress.
  hence in our midst it is not hard,
  here there was dullness; there, deceit and raving;
  here, there will be a ball; elsewhere, a children's fete.

  him does the snake of memories,
  him petted the sly spouse,
  him who has felt disturbs
  his dinner, and his wife.

  his former course for something.

  how I envied the waves
  how bitingly he'd tattle!
  how self-oblivious he could be!
  however, 'tis my business to describe;
  in both, the heart's glow had gone out;
  in chary fancies now and then
  in fact, I see (my guilt I lay before you)
  in general their conversation
  in great abstraction he has glanced,
  in jest astonish innocence,
  in letters of the heart, how casual!
  in something and somehow:
  in springtime on the turf of meads,

  in twenty-five cantos or so.

  might be diversified much less
  monotonous and motley, and tomorrow
  my young days sped.
  neither the gossip of the monde nor boston,
  next to unfinished lines,
  no cards, no balls, no verses.
  no, never did the surge of passions
  noise, and abuse!
  nonimitative oddity,
  not seldom do I hear the question:
  not to wear out the infant,
  nothing touched him;
  now talkative, now mute,
  now twines and now untwines her waist
  obedient to the magic bow,
  of a philosopher at eighteen years of age.
  of blind Fortuna and of men
  of complicated calumny,
  of jealous maidens, dedicate its strain?
  of ladies and of modish quizzes.
  of live and limpid poetry,
  of many (judges resolute and stern),
  of merriment, yawn wordlessly
  of poetry he doubled,
  of public tears, of plaudits
  of rhymes: thereby the sacred frenzy
  of the secluded cabinet,
  of thirty kinds —
  of unexpected epigrams.
  of workshops, waters, forests, lands,
  of yielding rugs.
  on all of them were different fetters;
  on any other subject than ourselves!
  on both, life weighed;
  on mirrory parquet of halls,
  on the Northern sad snow
  on the free crossway of the sea
  on whom I pass no judgment — for the reason
  only a boat, oars swinging,
  opened his vasisdas.
  oppressed by emptiness of soul,
  or else some publisher
  or precognizing from afar
  or the roses of flaming cheeks,

  possessed him by degrees.

  so inaccessible to men,
  so stately, so intelligent,
  so we'd be carried off in fancy
  something about it makes more charming
  soulful volation?
  sparkled Fonvízin, freedom's friend,
  still at the carriage porch the weary footmen
  still on the stage jump and make noise;
  still people have not ceased to stamp,
  still, chilled, the horses fidget,
  still, outside and inside,
  still, to tell you the truth,
  straight scissors, curvate ones, and brushes
  striding in Petrarch's tracks;
  surrounded by a throng of nymphs,
  swam on the dozing river,
  swarm of his comedies;
  take this collection of pied chapters:
  taught him all things in play,
  that I belong to them.
  that I have scrawled my portrait
  that he was clever and most charming.
  that in all Russia you will find
  that in inaction, in the [shade],
  that in the country, too, the boredom was the same,
  that my poor idiom as it is
  that the mere sight of them begets the spleen.7
  that there already waits for him [Kavérin];
  the Muse revived them later:
  the Okhta girl hastes with her jug,
  the best flower of French cookery,
  the blood within my withered heart,
  the breath of the benignant night
  the cabby to the hack stand drags,
  the careless fruit of my amusements,
  the coolness of the somber park,
  the crowd is occupied with the mazurka;
  the crush, the glitter, and the gladness,
  the demise of his aged uncle.
  the goddess drives to a masqued ball.
  the hearts of the professed coquettes!
  the inconsistencies are very many,
  the jealous whispering of fashionable women.
  the little feet of winsome ladies flit;
  the lyre's voice in the wild is more resounding,
  the music has already tired of dinning;
  the pen draws not, lost in a trance,
  the play of passions we knew both;
  the prejudices of innocent years
  the priests and guests ate, drank,
  the smiles of ladies with the fire
  the sovereign of courageous satire,
  the thirst for fame and praises,
  the tongue of Petrarch and of love.
  the twin lamps of coupés
  the words and gaze of the said charmers
  then somnolence already they induced;
  there Ózerov involuntary tributes
  there caustic Shahovskóy brought forth the noisy
  there clink the cavalier guard's spurs;
  there come and go the profiled heads
  there is no safer spot for declarations
  there, there, beneath the shelter of coulisses,
  they are not worth either the passions
  this would, no doubt, be daring;
  though I did erstwhile dip
  three pairs of shapely feminine feet.
  through the proud lyre of Albion
  thus I, carefree, would sing
  thus rive my soul!

  till vigilant Bréguet
  to dreams the involuntary addiction,
  to drown the hot fat of the cutlets;
  to entertain one half-alive,

  to him was loathsome: nothing
  to kiss the lips of young Armidas,
  to me 'tis known, to me 'tis kindred.
  to one another called,
  to rummage in the chronological
  to see strange lands;
  to the beginning of young life.
  to the dead man from every side
  to the reviewers for devourment.
  to touch the dear feet with my lips!
  to understand how the dignified Grimm
  to write long poems

  unclosed are shutters, chimney smoke
  unripe and withered years,

  upon their captivating tracks

  what would you more? The World decided
  whatever hungry taste in Paris,
  when he was taken gravely ill,
  when little billets would be brought him.
  when shall I start on my free course?
  when will the devil take you?”
  when, having donned a masculine attire,
  where I buried my heart.

  where maybe you were born,

  wherefore a sufferer
  which Naso sang,

 8 with men on every side
 8 yawning, took up a pen;
 8 you liked the sumptuous contact
 8 you remained friends with him:
12 — as if we were no longer able
12 “For whom does your lyre sigh?
12 As he'd left women, he left books
12 How quick and tender was his gaze,
12 Or else... else — God forbid!
12 The hyp was waiting for him on the watch,
12 Was it not thus in former years,
12 a horn and a brave song.
12 a punctual German in a cotton cap,
12 a slumbering clogged convict is transferred,
12 accustomed to his biting argument
12 across its whole-glassed windows shadows move:

12 and a decayless Strasbourg pie

12 swimming in a mysterious gondola;
